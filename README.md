# PressureMap
Pressure Mapping Impedance Tomography Evaluation Platform
# 
We're looking for contributors to help with the software and some electronic hardware using off-the-shelf platforms for visual pressure mapping impedance tomography using our impregnated sensor materials.

Sourcing the appropriate multiplexers and analog circuitry may require custom pc board design to be able to add on / plug into the developement platform.

This project should use 16, 32 or 64 electrodes and the sensing hardware shall be as noise free and sensitive as possible yet be able to perform the sensing as fast as possible.
